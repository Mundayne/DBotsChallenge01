- There are some amounts of words at high numbers (eg. 95, 96, 100, 110 and probably more) that seem to only have

- The number 29 in your generation code should really be a defined constant, as should the limit of 2000 characters.
+ Custom command handler is nice.
- It's a bit annoying that I can't just run `?lero 4` and get the 4 sentences - I have to give the amount afterwards, which is both long-winded and a little bit chat-spammy.
